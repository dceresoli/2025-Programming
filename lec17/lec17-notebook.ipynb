    "The Atomic Simulation Environment [ASE](https://ase-lib.org/) is a set of tools and Python modules for setting up, manipulating, running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations.\n",
    "Do you remember the `Molecule` class we developed in the previous lecture? ASE extends this concept to represent not only molecules but also periodic crystals, or low-dimensional systems like surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to that, ASE provides interfaces to different codes through **Calculators** which are used together with the central Atoms object and the many available algorithms in ASE.\n",

    "* **Flexible:** Since ASE is based on the Python scripting language it is possible to perform very complicated simulation tasks without any code modifications. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of simple *for-loop* constructions. There exist ASE modules for performing many standard simulation tasks.\n",
    "* **Customizable:** The Python code in ASE is structured in modules intended for different purposes. There are `ase.calculators` for calculating energies, forces and stresses, `ase.md` and `ase.optimize` modules for controlling the motion of atoms, `constraints` objects and filters for performing `nudged-elastic-band` calculations etc. The modularity of the object-oriented code make it simple to contribute new functionality to ASE.\n",
    "* **Pythonic:** It fits nicely into the rest of the Python world with use of the popular **NumPy** package for numerical work. The use of the Python language allows ASE to be used both interactively as well as in scripts.\n"

    "## 1. Getting started with ASE\n",
    "ASE can be imported by `import ase` and it's sub-packages like `import ase.io` or individual classes like `from ase.calculators.siesta import Siesta`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since ASE depends heavily on NumPy, we need also to `import numpy as np`. If you have a C/C++ and a Fortran compiler, and optionally a MPI library (for parallel execution), you can also install `gpaw` and the `asap3` packages. The first provide a DFT-PAW *calculator*, the second provides empirical potentials for large scale molecular dynamics. Anyway, we can use the built-in `EMT` *calculator* in this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ASE should be already installed in Anaconda. Under Linux/WSL you can install the official packages from your distribution. Otherwise, you can install any version of NumPy in a virtual environment using `pip` or `conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically one does:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create myenvinronment\n",
    "conda activate myenvironment\n",
    "conda install ase\n",
    "conda install gpaw asap3    # must have C/C++ compilers\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv myenvironment\n",
    ". myenvironment/bin/activate\n",
    "pip install ase\n",
    "pip install gpaw asap3      # must have C/C++ compilers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, if you want to use *external calculators* you must install other codes, like **Quantum Espresso**, **SIESTA**, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, many **Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs)** like **MACE**, **MatterSim**, provide an *ASE calculator* interface. Refer to those package for the installation procedure."
