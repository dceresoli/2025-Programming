    "Machine learning (ML) is a hot topic with popular applications in driverless cars, internet search engines, and data analysis among many others. Numerous fields are utilizing machine learning, and chemistry is certainly no exception, with papers using machine learning methods being published regularly. There is a considerable amount of hype around the topic along with debate about whether the field will live up to this hype. However, there is little doubt that machine learning is making a significant impact and is a powerful tool when used properly.\n",

While some coefficients are larger than others, we cannot yet distinguish which features are more important than the others because the values for each feature occur in different ranges. This is because the coefficients are not only proportional to the predictive value of a feature but also inversely proportional to the magnitude of feature values. For example, while the molecular mass has greater predictive value than the degree, the degree has a larger coefficient because it occurs in a smaller range (1 $\\rightarrow$ 3) than the molecular weights (32.04 $\\rightarrow$ 186.33 g/mol)."
