# Programming for Chemistry
The course introduces students to imperative programming by referring to the Python language.
The course is divided in two parts: the first presents [Python](https://www.python.org) and its object-oriented features,
the second focuses on libraries that can be useful in scientific computation and data analysis,
in particular [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org).

**Where:** Computer room 310, settore didattico, via Celoria

**When:**  Tuesdays and Fridays 08:30-10:30, starting from **Friday 26/09/2025**

**What:**  48 hours (24 lab-lectures, 2 hours each)

**Who:**   Dr. Davide Ceresoli, [davide.ceresoli@cnr.it](mailto:davide.ceresoli@cnr.it)

## General info
You are free to bring your own laptop. In this case, on first lecture you'll be required to setup
a working Python system with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).
If you prefer working *in the cloud*, you will be requested to setup a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) account.

## Text book
There are plenty of Python books/tutorial/course available for free, on many different topics.
For example, a good book is [How to think like a computer scientist in Python 3](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/)

## Exam
Because of AI code assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, ...) the exam will be individual and it will
consist in few general questions + coding a simple algorithm.
