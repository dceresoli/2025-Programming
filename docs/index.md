# 2025/2026 Programming (in Python) for Chemistry @ UniMI
The course introduces students to imperative programming by referring to the Python language.
The course is divided in two parts: the first presents [Python](https://www.python.org) and its object-oriented features,
the second focuses on libraries that can be useful in scientific computation and data analysis,
in particular (NumPy)[https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org).

**Where:** Computer room to be announced

**When:**  Tuesdays and Fridays 08:30-10:30 

**What:**  48 hours (24 lab-lectures, 2 hours each)

**Who:**   Dr. Davide Ceresoli, [davide.ceresoli@cnr.it](mailto:davide.ceresoli@cnr.it)

## General info
You are free to bring your own laptop. In this case, on first lecture you'll be required to setup
a working Python system with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).
If you prefer working *in the cloud*, you will be requested to setup a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) account.
